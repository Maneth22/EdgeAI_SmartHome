# AI Smart Home System

#### The project aims to develop a truly smart, AI-powered home automation system that will revolutionise conventional house automation. Its goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that provides energy consumption statistics, automates routine activities, and enhances security. In order to close the gap in the market, the system combines cutting-edge AI with IoT devices to provide a unique solution that promotes a responsive, secure, and safe home environment. The technology aims to raise the bar for smart living by using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from user behaviour and build connected, highly intelligent, and sustainable homes.
